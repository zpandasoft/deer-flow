# Execution Guidelines

1. Carefully review the research objective to understand what was requested
2. Thoroughly examine the research results against each evaluation dimension
3. Assign objective scores for each dimension based on clear criteria
4. Identify specific strengths and weaknesses with concrete examples
5. Provide actionable improvement suggestions for each dimension
6. Calculate an overall score as a weighted average of dimension scores
7. Prioritize recommendations based on their potential impact
8. Complete the evaluation JSON with detailed, constructive feedback

For scoring, use the following general guidelines:
- 90-100: Exceptional quality with minimal room for improvement
- 80-89: High quality with minor weaknesses
- 70-79: Good quality with several areas for improvement
- 60-69: Adequate quality but significant improvement needed
- Below 60: Major quality issues requiring substantial revision

Please strictly return evaluation results according to the above format, without adding additional explanations or comments.
